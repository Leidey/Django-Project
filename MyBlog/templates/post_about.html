    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>7th Blog was built to help people get started with gaining experience in <b>DevOps</b> area generally and much more than this, e.g blogging so they can help fund their lifestyle.
        I was always into web design and got myself a few freelance jobs setting up blogs and creating content for small local business.</p>
    <p>My name is Tunahan Yediel, I am 23 years old and live in a town called <i>Istanbul</i> in Turkey, with my family. It’s a beautiful part of the world and a place I can truly call home.</p>
    <p>I have spent the past few months building blogs and making an income from them so I can enjoy living in the countryside
        where I can enjoy lots of my favourite hobbies.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy reading my blog!</p>
    <p>Best.</p></body>
